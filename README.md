# Scala Dependency Injection

[Breakable Toy](https://scienceofcraftdotblog.wordpress.com/2021/02/28/breakable-toys/) to try out some ways of achieving dependency injection using idiomatic Scala.
This project demonstrates the following ways:
1. Manual Injection. Using new and lazy vals
2. DI Framework with MacWire.
3. Modules (combined with either manual or a DI framework)
