# Scala Dependency Injection

Breakable Toy to try out some ways of achieving dependency injection using idiomatic Scala.
This project demonstrates the following ways:
1. Manual Injection. Using new and lazy vals
2. DI Framework with MacWire.
3. Modules (combined with either manual or a DI framework)
